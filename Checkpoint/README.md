## Checkpoint
Creates a checkpoint system that will save a game object position during gameplay and load it whenever asked

### Checkpoint.cs
Add this script to the game object you wish to make a checkpoint of
- Check the "Is Default" box if it's that's the first checkpoint to be used when the game starts
- Set the "Respawn Position" to a transform where you wish your game object to respawn
- Fiddle with the "Respawn Speed" to make the respawn faster or slower
