# Unity Scripts
This repo includes a collection of useful and reusable Unity C# scripts
Not all scripts were created by me so I won't take credit for all of them
Just keep in mind some are missing credits cause they were found randomly on the web and even though I may have added namespaces on some, that's just for good practice. Have fun!

## Liquid Wobble

## Parallax
